                I'm <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cargo-run/" class="underline">Mark</a> 🖤, a student at Harvard studying math and
                computer science. I like data structures and algorithms and have a bit too much free time.
                Oh, and I'm probably going to graduate soon, if you know any cool places to work. ;)
