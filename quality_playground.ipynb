      "Bausch & Lomb said that Hakan Edstrom, who oversaw the company's contact lens, lens-care products, surgical and other businesses in North and South America, had resigned to pursue other opportunities. Bausch & Lomb, a leading maker of contact lenses, said earlier this month that fourth-quarter profit would fall short of Wall Street's expectations because of slowing demand for a vision-correction laser surgery procedure known as Lasik. The company said Mr. Edstrom, who was president of the Americas division, would pursue other career opportunities and declined to comment further. Shares of Bausch & Lomb, which is based in Rochester, fell 80 cents, to $45.08. Last week, Bausch & Lomb said profit from operations in the fourth quarter fell to $37.4 million, or 70 cents a share, from $51.4 million, or 88 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier as demand slowed for lens-care products and laser-surgery equipment.\n",

At the same time, we see our role on the Web as being similar to our traditional, print role -- to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide to our customers information they need and can trust,\" said Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., publisher of The New York Times. The site looks quite a bit different than it did in five years ago, but its aspirations are largely the same: to be the best news and information site on the Internet. With that in mind, Bernard Gwertzman, editor of The New York Times on the Web, and Martin Nisenholtz, chief executive officer of New York Times Digital, sat down to discuss their five years on the Web, the state of Internet journalism today, and what we can expect in years to come. The discussion was moderated by Bill Goldstein, the Books Editor of NYTimes.com.\n",

I know because there is a small memorial there. The closest rapid transit station to me was the major point of embarkation to the concentration camps for Berlin's Jews.
